# Play around with it
Do you wonder why the prediction is different from your actual sex? You can find out which character in your name leads to which sex by how much by replacing that character with any non-Chinese character such as English letter 'x', 'y', 'z'. The prediction is then made based on remaining legitimate Chinese characters. Also, you can choose not to use any one of the training sets by simply commenting out codes reading data from that training set.

# The author does not in any way embrace this binary classification of sex, but rather because the training set contains only male and female.
